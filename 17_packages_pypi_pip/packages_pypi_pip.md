# Packages, PyPI, and PIP

- Module: a module is a single Python file. Typically, this file contains variables, and functions that we can import.
- Packages: a package is a collection of modules along with a `__init__` file.
- PyPI: [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) stands for The Python Package Index. It is a repository for third-party packages.
- PIP: pip is a package manager for Python. We can use it to install Python packages.
